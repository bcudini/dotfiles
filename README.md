# My dotfiles

Actually, they're mostly my workplace dotfiles: as they are shared with my
colleagues on the servers, I don't put too much customisation in it (like
unbinding arrows in Vim). At least not anything that would change to much the
default behavior of a program, I almost got beaten to death for that and it's
definitely not cool.
